<p>Like many inventions also the blasting process has evolved from a natural phenomenon. Legend has it that Benjamin Chew Tilghman (1821 - 1901) had seen the effect of wind-blown sand on windows in the desert while a general in the army, and that this was the basis of his sandblasting invention.</p>

<p>Around 1870, he invented the Sandblasting process and filed his first patent for it in the U.S. and later in the UK, detailing many of the applications for which this technique is uniquely suited. Examining his patents it will be found that Tilghman had in these thoughts covered all the possible principles of the process, even though it took eventually sixty years for all ideas to be perfected!</p>

<p>Further patents and developments from Tilghman and others followed, leading to the progress of blasting methods and machinery. Also nowadays innovations take place in perfecting blasting methods, abrasives, usability and operator's comfort.</p>
